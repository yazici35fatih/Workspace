This is a project that only managers can see and employees can add value to.
I added the name and surname tcno when creating the user. You can change tcno.
 This is a Republic of Turkey Identity Card.
 Then I divided it into two: academic and contractual.
 For academics, a limit of 80% study rate was set at most within a month.
 The contracts are 100% done.
 If a person is working on another project and their dates are the same and they are academic, a limit is set to a maximum of 80% of their monthly work rate total.
 Let's say you entered 0.3 in one of the overlapping months.
 In the other one it will show 0.5 at most.
Apart from these, most things are clear.
 The codes of the page are in English, but the page is currently in Turkish.
 Language support will be added to the page.


This project is carried out by Ostim Technical University Dr. It was given to me as an assignment by lecturer Levent Emmungil during my internship.
 It was created for Middle East Technical University.
